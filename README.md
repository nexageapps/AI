# AI Learning — Beginner Python Notebooks (Google Colab)

Welcome! This repository documents a hands-on learning path for Python and introductory AI concepts using Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab-ready). The notebooks progress from basic Python and arithmetic up through simple machine learning and an introduction to NLP tokenization.

Repository language composition: Jupyter Notebook (100%)

---

## What you’ll find here

- Colab-ready Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations and runnable code cells.
- Beginner-friendly examples covering: Python basics, simple plotting, a binary classification example, and an introduction to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization.

## Run these notebooks in Google Colab

Open any notebook directly in Colab using this pattern:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/nexageapps/AI/blob/main/<path-to-notebook.ipynb>

Or click any notebook file in this repository and choose "Open in Colab" (if available). Colab runs in the cloud — no local install required.

## Requirements

- Google account (to save/run notebooks in Colab)
- Internet connection
