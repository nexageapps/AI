# AI Learning — Beginner Python Notebooks (Google Colab)

This repository documents my journey in learning **Python programming** and **basic AI concepts**, implemented in **Google Colab notebooks**.  
It starts with fundamental Python skills and gradually introduces simple machine learning tasks.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run on Google Colab

You can open any notebook directly in Google Colab:  

1️⃣ Click the notebook file in the repository on GitHub.  
2️⃣ Click the **"Open in Colab"** button (or right-click the file URL and open it in Colab).  
3️⃣ Run the cells step by step.

Alternatively:  

📌 Paste the notebook URL into Colab:  
[https://colab.research.google.com/github/nexageapps/AI/blob/main/](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nexageapps/AI/blob/main/)  

and navigate to the file you want to open.
